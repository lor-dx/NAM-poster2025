# Modelling and Fitting of Background Source Continua in Molecular Cloud Ice Spectra

This is a digital version of the poster I have presented at NAM (National Astronomy Meeting) 2025 in Durham. 

I've also uploaded the plots in higher quality. Comparison between observed data [McClure et al (2023)][1] and my simulated observation for stars J110621 and NIR38:

 - [nir38_spectrum_model.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21014609/nir38_spectrum_model.pdf)


Zoom in on the $^{13}\text{CO}$ and $^{13}\text{CO}_2$ features in the spectrum on J110621.
